I am a Ph.D candidate at School of Mechanical Science & Engineering at Huazhong University of Science and Technology,
supervised by [Weiming Shen](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=FuSHsx4AAAAJ&hl=vi).

I am interested in computer vision, especially applications of industrial areas. My goal is to
boost the level of intelligence in industrial manufacturing. My recently research interests focus
on **anomaly detection for industrial images**.
